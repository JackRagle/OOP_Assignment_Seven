The executable jar file is located inside the "src/sortInAction" folder.

If you would like to sort your own array, enter each integer of the array into its own line in the "inputArray.txt" file located in the "OOP_Assignment_Seven" folder.
After saving your input to the text file, run the program with the text file as an argument.

If you would like to run the program with a random array, run the program with no arguments. The user will be prompted to enter the size of the random array and then it will be sorted.

After the array is sorted, it will be saved to the "output.txt" file located in the "OOP_Assignment_Seven" folder.
